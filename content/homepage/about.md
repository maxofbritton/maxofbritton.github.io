# About

üëãüèº Hey, my name is Max! I'm a mechanical engineer and software developer, I specialize in using my self-taught programming skills and formal engineering education to build software solutions to the toughest engineering problems.

üåá Boston born and raised, as a kid I was always takings things apart to try and figure out their inner-workings (often breaking them in the process!), and matured into a natural problem solver. I fell in love with programming in middle school, when I discovered computers could do anything I could - but faster and better. 

ü•á My high school highlight was winning the [F1 in Schools](https://www.f1inschools.com/) STEM competition alongside my brother. The prize? A full-fees bursary to UCL to study Mechanical Engineering.

üìö At university, I used my engineering smarts to make up for my lack of racecar driving ability to develop a Reinforcement Learning based self-driving race car. It didn't work well, but I learned a lot along the way! For my Master's thesis, I partnered with a Formula 1 team to use Machine Learning improve race-strategy predictions.

üèÅ As my ambitions grew, I realized I couldn't achieve my dreams on my own. In third year, I lead our Formula Student (Formula SAE) team to competition for the first time in five years. Since then, I've used my honed in skills to race actual Formula 1 cars at the cutting edge of motorsport.

ü™ê I'm really excited about [JuliaLang](https://julialang.org/) and [Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai). I'm a firm believer that the future of scientific modeling lies in leveraging machine learning to combine centuries of physics-based modelling with the vast quantities of data available today. In my future, I hope to use my skills to fight climate change and equip humanity to explore the Moon, Mars and beyond.
