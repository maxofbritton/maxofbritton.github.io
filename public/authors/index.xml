      <description>👋🏼 Hey, my name is Maximilian, but everyone calls me Max! I&amp;rsquo;m a mechanical engineer and software devloper, I specialize in using my self-taught programming skills and formal engineering education to build software solutions to the toughest engineering problems.
🌇 Boston born and raised, as a kid I was always takings things apart to try and figure out their innerworkings (often breaking them in the process!), and matured into a natural problem solver. I fell in love with programming in middle school, when I discovered computers could do anything I could - but faster and better.</description>
